# F28379D_LCD1602
Want to use LCD1602 on TI C2000 Delfino F28379D? Here is the library. <br/>
Header file contains the Hardware connection for F28379D and LCD1602. <br/>
My LCD1602 is ADM1602K, so I use 5V supply. Different LCD might use 3.3V. Confirm VDD with datasheet. <br/>
To use the code, simply include the header file and drag the .c file into the project. <br/>
Or you can download the zip file name "F28379D_lcd1602". Unzip it and import it as CCS project. There is sample code for running.
